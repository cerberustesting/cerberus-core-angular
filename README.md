# cerberus-angular
Brand new Cerberus front-end implementation

[![Test Status](https://prod.cerberus-testing.com/ResultCIV003?campaign=FrontRegression&outputformat=svg&t=180131)](https://prod.cerberus-testing.com/)

# get started

## dev environment

Current codebase is being developed with the following tools:

- node 14.16.1 (`node -v`)
- npm 6.14.12 (`npm -v`)
- Angular 8.2.0 (`ng version`)
- Typescript 3.5.3 (`tsc -v`)

For Linux and macOS, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and use different versions of node through the command line (npm is included in node). For Windows, you can use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

To install Angular 8.2.0, run:

- `npm install -g @angular/cli@8.2.0`
- `npm install -g @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.803.24`
- `npm install -g @angular/compiler-cli@8.2.0`
- `npm install -g @angular/language-service@8.2.0`
- `npm install -g @angular/compiler@8.2.0`

To install Typescript 3.5.3, run:

-`npm install -g typescript@3.5.3`

## run

After your dev environment is all set up (see previous section), just do:

- `npm install`
- `ng serve`

If after running `ng serve` you get the error "You seem to not be depending on "@angular/core" and/or "rxjs". This is an error.", run `npm link` and try again.

# installation guide

This application is secured by keycloak (https://www.keycloak.org).

You can both :
- connect it to an online Cerberus environment (https://qa.cerberus-testing.org) where data are safe to edit.

You just have to clone the repo and you're good to go. An internet connection is therefore necessary.
NB: You must deploy the application on default port 4200 (only this URL is configured on the online keycloak)

- connect it to a local Cerberus instance that you have to deploy locally

Please follow the instructions on cerberus-source repository (https://github.com/cerberustesting/cerberus-source/blob/master/INSTALL.tomcat) to deploy Cerberus and Keycloak on your local environment.

In cerberus-angular, edit  `environment.ts` file with your corresponding URLs :

- keycloak auth URL in the `keycloakConfig` object
``` javascript
// KEYCLOAK INFORMATION
let keycloakConfig: any = {
  url: 'http://localhost:38080/auth', //right here
  realm: 'Cerberus',
  clientId: 'cerberus-angular'
};
```
- the cerberus source URL in the same object
``` javascript
// CERBERUS API ENDPOINT
let API_endpoint: string = "http://localhost:8080";
```

The application is configured by default to work with `cerberus-angular` keycloak client with the following configuration :
- Enabled : ON
- Client protocol : openid-connect
- Access Type : public
- Standard Flow Enabled : ON
- Valid Redirect URIs : your cerberus angular URL (or URI if Root URL is configured) (e.g. http://localhost:4200/*)
- Web Origins : add "+"
